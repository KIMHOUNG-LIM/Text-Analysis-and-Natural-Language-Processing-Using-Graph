# Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing Using Graph

This repository contains my practice work on text analysis using graph-based methods, as outlined in Chapter 7 of the book *Graph Machine Learning* by Claudio Stamile, Aldo Marzullo, and Enrico Deusebio.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to explore various techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the use of graph structures. The practices are designed to enhance understanding and application of key concepts in NLP, such as text segmentation, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), dependency parsing, lemmatization, knowledge graphs, and multi-label classification.

## Practices

### Practice 1: Text Preprocessing

This practice focuses on the fundamental concepts and tools used in NLP. Key topics include:

- **Text Segmentation**: Dividing text into meaningful units.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying the grammatical parts of speech in the text.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detecting and classifying named entities in the text.
- **Dependency Parsing**: Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence.
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form.

### Practice 2: Knowledge Graph Implementation

This practice involves constructing a knowledge graph to capture the meanings of words and their relationships within sentences. The focus is on:

- Building a graph-based representation of text.
- Inferring relationships between different entities in the text.

### Practice 3: Document Clustering Using Bipartite Graphs

In this practice, we address the limitations of knowledge graphs in clustering documents by their meanings. The main tasks include:

- Implementing bipartite graphs to cluster documents based on semantic similarity.
- Enhancing document clustering techniques through graph-based methods.

### Practice 4: Multi-Label Classification Using Bipartite Entity-Document Graphs

This practice aims to leverage the information and connections between entities from bipartite entity-document graphs to train multi-label classifiers. The objectives are:

- Utilizing bipartite graphs for feature extraction.
- Training multi-label classifiers to predict document topics based on extracted features.
